# Building Microservices
Code repository for my Building Microservices series

## Content:
Over the weeks I will be exploring the following topics, learning everything I need to know regarding building microservices with the go programming language:

- Introduction to microservices
- RESTFul microservices
- gRPC microservices
- Packaging applications with Docker
- Testing microservice
- Continuous Delivery
- Observability
- Using Kubernetes
- Debugging
- Security
- Asynchronous microservices
- Caching
- Microservice reliability using a Service Mesh


## Episode 1 - Building a simple microservice

### Branch: [episode_1](https://github.com/jedrekdomanski/microservices/tree/episode-1)

In this episode I learn how to build the simplest service you can using the standard packages in the Go programming language.

## Episode 2 - Building a simple microservice, continued

### Branch: [episode_2](https://github.com/jedrekdomanski/microservices/tree/episode-2)

In this episode I learn more about the standard library and look at how I can refactor last episodes example into a reusable microservice pattern.

## Episode 3 - RESTFul microservices
### Branch: [episode_3](https://github.com/jedrekdomanski/microservices/tree/episode-3)

In this episode I start to learn about RESTFul services and reading and writing data using the JSON format.

## Episode 4 - RESTFul microservices
### Branch: [episode_4](https://github.com/jedrekdomanski/microservices/tree/episode-4)

I continue to look at how you can implement RESTFul services with the Standard API

## Episode 5 - Gorilla toolkit
### Branch: [episode_5](https://github.com/jedrekdomanski/microservices/tree/episode-5)

In this epsode I refactor my Standard library RESTful service and start to implement the Gorilla toolkit for routing.
